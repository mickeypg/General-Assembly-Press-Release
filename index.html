            <h1>GENERAL ASSEMBLY HONORED AT MIT INCLUSIVE INNOVATION COMPETITION</h1>
            <h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>
            <p class="date">10/27/16</p>
            <p>General Assembly has an ambitious vision for the future. We’re working toward a world in which we can close the global skills gap, ensuring that everyone — regardless of social or economic barriers — has access to the training they need to pursue a career they love. To achieve this goal, we work closely with employers to understand the workforce they need, and then empower students and employees with these skills.</p>
            <p>Our commitment is getting noticed.</p>
            <p>In September, MIT honored General Assembly as a finalist in its Inclusive Innovation Competition. The contest identifies and celebrates organizations that are inventing a more inclusive, productive, and sustainable future for all. Like us, they see the importance of a network of organizations learning from one another and working together to solve important social challenges. </p>
